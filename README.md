**Face recognition models** 

DeepFace is a **hybrid** face recognition package. It currently wraps many **state-of-the-art** face recognition models: [`VGG-Face`](https://sefiks.com/2018/08/06/deep-face-recognition-with-keras/) , [`FaceNet`](https://sefiks.com/2018/09/03/face-recognition-with-facenet-in-keras/), [`OpenFace`](https://sefiks.com/2019/07/21/face-recognition-with-openface-in-keras/), [`DeepFace`](https://sefiks.com/2020/02/17/face-recognition-with-facebook-deepface-in-keras/), [`DeepID`](https://sefiks.com/2020/06/16/face-recognition-with-deepid-in-keras/), [`ArcFace`](https://sefiks.com/2020/12/14/deep-face-recognition-with-arcface-in-keras-and-python/), [`Dlib`](https://sefiks.com/2020/07/11/face-recognition-with-dlib-in-python/), `SFace` and `GhostFaceNet`. The default configuration uses VGG-Face model.

```python
models = [
  "VGG-Face", 
  "Facenet", 
  "Facenet512", 
  "OpenFace", 
  "DeepFace", 
  "DeepID", 
  "ArcFace", 
  "Dlib", 
  "SFace",
  "GhostFaceNet",
]

#face verification
result = DeepFace.verify(
  img1_path = "img1.jpg",
  img2_path = "img2.jpg",
  model_name = models[0],
)

#face recognition
dfs = DeepFace.find(
  img_path = "img1.jpg",
  db_path = "C:/workspace/my_db", 
  model_name = models[1],
)

#embeddings
embedding_objs = DeepFace.represent(
  img_path = "img.jpg",
  model_name = models[2],
)
```

FaceNet, VGG-Face, ArcFace and Dlib are overperforming ones based on experiments - see [`BENCHMARKS`](https://github.com/serengil/deepface/tree/master/benchmarks) for more details. You can find the measured scores of various models in DeepFace and the reported scores from their original studies in the following table.

| Model          | Measured Score | Declared Score     |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Facenet512     | 98.4%          | 99.6%              |
| Human-beings   | 97.5%          | 97.5%              |
| Facenet        | 97.4%          | 99.2%              |
| Dlib           | 96.8%          | 99.3 %             |
| VGG-Face       | 96.7%          | 98.9%              |
| ArcFace        | 96.7%          | 99.5%              |
| GhostFaceNet   | 93.3%          | 99.7%              |
| SFace          | 93.0%          | 99.5%              |
| OpenFace       | 78.7%          | 92.9%              |
| DeepFace       | 69.0%          | 97.3%              |
| DeepID         | 66.5%          | 97.4%              |

Conducting experiments with those models within DeepFace may reveal disparities compared to the original studies, owing to the adoption of distinct detection or normalization techniques. Furthermore, some models have been released solely with their backbones, lacking pre-trained weights. Thus, we are utilizing their re-implementations instead of the original pre-trained weights.

# VGG-16

A convolutional neural network is also known as a ConvNet, which is a kind of artificial neural network. A convolutional neural network has an input layer, an output layer, and various hidden layers. VGG16 is a type of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) that is considered to be one of the best computer vision models to date. The creators of this model evaluated the networks and increased the depth using an architecture with very small (3 × 3) convolution filters, which showed a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations. They pushed the depth to 16–19 weight layers making it approx — 138 trainable parameters.

### Features
- The 16 in VGG16 refers to 16 layers that have weights. In VGG16 there are thirteen convolutional layers, five Max Pooling layers, and three Dense layers which sum up to 21 layers but it has only sixteen weight layers i.e., learnable parameters layer.
VGG16 takes input tensor size as 224, 244 with 3 RGB channel
- Most unique thing about VGG16 is that instead of having a large number of hyper-parameters they focused on having convolution layers of 3x3 filter with stride 1 and always used the same padding and maxpool layer of 2x2 filter of stride 2.
- The convolution and max pool layers are consistently arranged throughout the whole architecture
- Conv-1 Layer has 64 number of filters, Conv-2 has 128 filters, Conv-3 has 256 filters, Conv 4 and Conv 5 has 512 filters.
- Three Fully-Connected (FC) layers follow a stack of convolutional layers: the first two have 4096 channels each, the third performs 1000-way ILSVRC classification and thus contains 1000 channels (one for each class). The final layer is the soft-max layer.

### Architecture
- **Inputs** : The VGGNet accepts 224224-pixel images as input. To maintain a consistent input size for the ImageNet competition, the model’s developers chopped out the central 224224 patches in each image.
- **Convolutional Layers** : VGG’s convolutional layers use the smallest feasible receptive field, or 33, to record left-to-right and up-to-down movement. Additionally, 11 convolution filters are used to transform the input linearly. The next component is a ReLU unit, a significant advancement from AlexNet that shortens training time. Rectified linear unit activation function, or ReLU, is a piecewise linear function that, if the input is positive, outputs the input; otherwise, the output is zero. The convolution stride is fixed at 1 pixel to keep the spatial resolution preserved after convolution (stride is the number of pixel shifts over the input matrix).
- **Hidden Layers** : The VGG network’s hidden layers all make use of ReLU. Local Response Normalization (LRN) is typically not used with VGG as it increases memory usage and training time. Furthermore, it doesn’t increase overall accuracy.
- **Fully Connected Layers** : The VGGNet contains three layers with full connectivity. The first two levels each have 4096 channels, while the third layer has 1000 channels with one channel for each class.
